## üìñ Overview

Early detection of **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** can significantly improve outcomes by providing early interventions and tailored resources for children. This app utilizes a **Naive Bayes classifier** to predict the likelihood of autism in toddlers based on behavioral and developmental data. The model is designed to be **interpretable** and **accurate**, offering caregivers insights into their child‚Äôs developmental health.

We began this project by exploring several key research papers related to **Graphical Models for Health Diagnosis**, including:

- [Employing Bayesian Networks for the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Diseases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06400)
- [Bayesian Networks for the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Diseases: A Scoping Review](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-4990/6/2/58)
- [Impact of Bayesian Network Model Structure on the Accuracy of Medical Diagnostic Systems](https://ali-fahmi.github.io/files/papers/paper5.pdf)

Through this research, we gained foundational insights into Bayesian Networks, understanding their mathematical underpinnings, advantages, challenges, and applications in healthcare. A pivotal study, *Bayesian Networks in Healthcare: What is Preventing Their Adoption?* by Evangelia Kyrimi et al., informed our approach, especially in autism detection, where we found additional papers like *An Intelligent Bayesian Hybrid Approach to Help Autism Diagnosis* by Paulo Vitor de Campos Souza et al.

## ‚ú® Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy navigation and clear prompts for data entry.
- **Comprehensive Data Collection**: Gathers demographic info, family history, health indicators (e.g., jaundice), and behavioral assessments.
- **Behavioral Questionnaire**: Includes questions evaluating developmental behaviors like eye contact and social interaction.
- **Machine Learning Predictions**: Uses a Naive Bayes classifier to analyze user input and predict ASD likelihood.
- **Clear Results and Insights**: Provides probability-based predictions with interpretative insights.
- **Educational Resources**: Links to information on autism signs and early detection importance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of terminal commands.


## üß¨ Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: We used an autism screening dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fabdelja/autism-screening-for-toddlers). We cleaned and preprocessed the data, addressing missing values and normalizing attributes.
2. **Modeling with Naive Bayes**: Our initial classifier was Naive Bayes, chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling probabilistic predictions. We also experimented with **Random Forest** and **Ensemble Models** for comparison.
3. **Frontend Implementation**: To showcase the Naive Bayes classifier, we built a basic frontend using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS**.
4. **Testing and Evaluation**: We compared model accuracy across Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Ensemble Models to determine the most reliable predictor. 
5. The whole project can be viewed on this repository.

## üìà Results

The app provides **probabilistic predictions** with an emphasis on **interpretability**, helping caregivers understand which factors significantly influence autism likelihood.
